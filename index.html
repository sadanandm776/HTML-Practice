          I am learning web development in 2026 which i decided in way back in school when i was a kid almost in 2022 when coding was just started to get it's deserving spotlight.
          so it took me almost 4 years to start to get to know and actually move my hands.
          it's exciting as anything like my other goals like being able to Dance - play Badminton - scorring Goals - owening Continental GT650 - learning Astrophysics - running - buying expensive shoes and running gears.
          all that bring joy to me and now as i am even able to understand things in basic HTML setting makes me feel overwhelming.
          Remember this is just the starting i know that i can do much better than i can expect from myself so lets go... 
          Stay Glories  🌻
